RELEASE NOTE v1.0.0

    Punisher no longer uses cUrl to fetch https requests, but instead uses PHP functions directly through the use of openssl. Be sure you have compiled PHP with --with-openssl and openssl is enabled in your php.ini.

    If either $cafile or $capath is set, SSL certificate verification is enabled. See the README.

    Added getResults() method, simple returning $punisher->results property;

    Punisher methods are now chainable, so for instance this is valid: $res = $punisher->fetch('http://www.google.com')->getResults();
